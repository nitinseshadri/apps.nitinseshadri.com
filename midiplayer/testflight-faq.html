<h1>TestFlight Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p>Thank you for testing out a beta of NS MIDI Player! This page contains answers to some frequently asked questions about TestFlight. If you have any other questions, please <a href="support.html">contact me</a> or refer to <a href="https://testflight.apple.com">the TestFlight website.</a></p>

<h2>Q: I deleted the beta app, but I am still receiving email notifications from TestFlight. Why?</h2>
<p>A: Deleting the app is not enough to stop notifications from TestFlight. If you want to stop receiving notifications, you will need to remove yourself as a tester in the TestFlight app. For more information, please see the <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/#:~:text=If%20you%20accepted%20the%20invitation%20and%20no%20longer%20wish%20to%20test%20the%20app%2C%20you%20can%20delete%20yourself%20as%20a%20tester%20by%20visiting%20the%20app%E2%80%99s%20Information%20page%20in%20TestFlight%20and%20tapping%20Stop%20Testing.">"Opting out from testing" section of the TestFlight website.</a></p>
